Adds radial menus where you can enable an idle animation. This is the equivalent of players emoting in an MMORPG. The animations used in this
mod are ones from the campaign, or other animations that you wouldn't normally see (or are simply unused in the game to begin with). I've also added
an animation that involves two players, similar to the "The High Five!" taunt from TF2.

This version requires the ACE mod as it uses their menu system.
This must be compiled into a PBO file if used as a mod. Otherwise, it can be added to a mission's scripts for use for all players.
